# Introduction
Unity have its own Third Person Controller package that can be acquired from the  [asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/starter-assets-third-person-character-controller-196526).

# Why use this version then?
This package comes with the same code with a few tweaks and it uses the Input Manager instead.

## Disclaimer
The animations and model used in this project came all from [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com/#/).
